EF Core run on top of dotnet core and dotnet core runs on core CLR

dotnet core runs in 

1) OS
Windows, MAC, Linux

2) 

a) Full dotnet Framworks & Apps

Full dotnet framework that is above 4.5.1+, and apps that run on Full dotnet framwork like console, winforms, WPF, ASP.NET 4

b) CoreCLR and Apps

AspNet core web apps, APIs, libraries, services, console apps

c) UWP (Universal Windows Platform) on Windows 10

Apps: Mobile, PC, HoloLens, XBox, IoT, Surface Hub


If we are targeting cross platform we have to use EF core

But if we fix that the application will stay on windows, then we can use Aspnet core with EF 6. Create EF 6 in class library, and call that library from AspNet core app.
